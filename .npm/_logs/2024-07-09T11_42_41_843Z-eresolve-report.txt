# npm resolution error report

While resolving: undefined@undefined
Found: react@19.0.0-rc-fb9a90fa48-20240614
node_modules/react
  react@"^19.0.0-rc-4c2e457c7c-20240522" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer react@">=16.8" from react-router-dom@6.24.1

  react-router-dom@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
